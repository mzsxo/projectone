<div class="scroll-box">Hello! My name is Sabrina. I was born and raised in Queens, New York. I love to creatively express myself in any and every way, so it wasn‚Äôt a surprise I took a liking to web and graphic design. I started pretty roughly, not gonna lie. Do you remember MySpace? Yeah, THAT website is what started it all. I‚Äôm a bit OCD and quite the perfectionist so about ten years ago, young me would sit there for hours cutting and pasting other people‚Äôs codes trying to change my themes and layouts to exactly how I wanted them. That progressed into making my own codes for me and my friends. Same thing goes with graphic design, I didn‚Äôt like other people‚Äôs tags and names on MY profile so I started making my own graphics for me and my friends. I have coded many personal blog sites, (unprofessionally.) I‚Äôve also designed or helped design many banners, logos, and avatar pictures for various social media influencers and YouTubers, (EXTREMELY unprofessionally.) It was and still is my biggest hobby so I‚Äôve always been open to requests because I genuinely do enjoy this. Unfortunately, I never took it seriously until now <span style='color:red;text-decoration:line-through'><span style='color:white'>because I‚Äôm broke, help</span></span> because my family discouraged any job on the arts spectrum so I never thought you could enjoy your career that much.
